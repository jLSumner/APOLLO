APOLLO: A Command & Control Mainframe

User Guide

Jayden L. Sumner
Edition 1
Aug 2025

1.	System Overview
APOLLO is a high-level, text-based command and control (C2) application designed to monitor and automate a network of remote systems, referred to as “plugins”. It serves as a central hub for receiving status updates from distributed components and issuing commands based on a predefined set of rules, or “directives”.
Built in Rust, APOLLO is designed for stability, performance, and security, providing a robust platform for managing complex, automated environments. Its primary function is to close the control loop between system monitoring and automated action by:
  1.	Listening: Securely receiving real-time status updates from a hierarchical network of plugins, subsections, and entities.
  2.	Deciding: Processing these status updates through a powerful Directive Engine, which evaluates them against a user-defined rulebook.
  3.	Acting: Issuing commands to any component on the network when the conditions of a directive are met.
This allows for the creation of a fully autonomous system where APOLLO acts as the central decision-making authority.


2.	Authorised Administrator
Access to APOLLO is restricted to a single, high-privilege user account. All critical system functions, including plugin management, directive creation, and dictionary editing, require successful authentication.
The credentials are hardcoded into the system for maximum security.
Please see the current Administrator for access.


3.	Plugin Monitor (1)
This view provides a real-time, at-a-glance overview of all plugins that have successfully authenticated with and are actively connected to APOLLO.
Purpose:
The primary purpose of the Plugin Monitor is to provide immediate situational awareness of the entire connected network. It allows the operator to confirm that all expected systems are online and to see the last reported status of each component.
Functionality:
  -	Real-time Updates: The list updates instantly as plugins connect, disconnect, or report new statuses.
  -	Status Display: Each line in the monitor provides three key pieces of information:
    o	Entity ID: The unique identifier of the plugin (e.g., ARC_MED_DOOR001).
    o	Status: The last status code reported by that plugin (e.g., OPERATIONAL, NOMINAL, BREACH_DETECTED).
    o	Last Seen: A timestamp indicating when the last heartbeat or status update was received from the plugin.
  -	Automatic Timeout: The system actively monitors for plugin connectivity. If a plugin does not send a status update or heartbeat within 15 seconds, it is considered “TIMEOUT” and will be automatically removed from this list, triggering a [MONITOR] log event.


4.	System Logs (2)
This view provides comprehensive access to all log messages generated by the APOLLO system, from core processes to individual plugin interactions. It is essential for diagnostics, auditing, and understanding system behavior. 
The view has two distinct modes, which can be switched between using the Left and Right arrow keys.

Live View:
  -	Purpose: To see real-time, auto-scrolling stream of all system activity as it happens. This is the default view and is critical for observing immediate cause-and-effect.
  -	Display: Show the last 500 log messages. Log tags are color-coded for rapid identification of the source system:

    o	[CORE]: Green
    o	[gRPC]: Yellow
    o	[AUTH]: LightBlue
    o	[STATE]: Magenta
    o	[DIRECTIVE]: Red (Bold)
    o	[MONITOR]: Cyan
    o	[CONFIG]: Blue
   	
Log Browser:
  -	Purpose: To load, view, and scroll through historical log files. APOLLO automatically saves a new log file for each day of operation, and this mode allows the operator to review any past day’s events.
  -	Navigation:
    o	Use the UP/DOWN arrows to select a log file from the list. Files are named APOLLO-YYYY-MM-DD.log
    o	Press Enter to load the selected file’s contents.
    o	Use the UP/DOWN arrows to scroll through the log file from start to finish.
    o	Press BACKSPACE to return to the file list.

5.	System Directives (3)
This view is the heart of APOLLO’s automation capabilities. It allows the operator to create, view, and remove the rules that govern the system’s autonomous behavior.

What is a Directive?
  A Directive is a conditional rule that follows a simple but powerful “IF-THIS-THEN-THAT” logic. It instructs APOLLO to watch for a specific status from one component on the network and, when that status is received, to automatically issue a specific command to another (or the same) component.
  -	Example: IF the entity SEC_CAM_001 reports a status of BREACH_DETECTED, THEN issue the command SEAL_DOORS to the entity ARC_MED.
  This system allows for the creation of complex, chained autonomations without any manual intervention.

How to Add a New Directive:
  Adding a directive is a guided, 5-step process. Use the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to switch to “Add Directive” mode to begin.
  1.	Select Trigger Target
    -	Goal: Choose the specific entity that will trigger the rule.
    -	Action: The plugin hierarchy is displayed. Navigate the tree using the UP/DOWN arrows. Expand or collapse Plugin and Subsection nodes using TAB/SHIFT+TAB. Highlight the desired Plugin, Subsection, or Entity, and press ENTER.
  2.	Select Trigger Status
    -	Goal: Choose the status from the target Plugin, Subsection, or Entity, that will activate the rule.
    -	Action: A list of all available status codes for the selected Plugin, Subsection, or Entity, appears on the right. Navigate this list with UP/DOWN arrows and press ENTER to select one.
  3.	Select Action Target
    -	Goal: Choose the Plugin, Subsection, or Entity, that will receive the command when the rule is triggered.
    -	Action: The plugin hierarchy is displayed again. Navigate to the target Plugin, Subsection, or Entity, for the command and press ENTER.
  4.	Select Action Command
    -	Goal: Choose the command to be sent to the action target.
    -	Action: A list of all available commands for the target Plugin, Subsection, or Entity, appears on the right. Navigate this list with the UP/DOWN arrows and press ENTER to select one.
  5.	Confirm Directive
    -	Goal: Review the complete directive for accuracy before saving it to the system.
    -	Action: A final confirmation screen displays the full “IF-THIS-THEN-THAT” logic.
      o	Press INSERT to save the directive to directives.json.
      o	Press END to cancel the entire process at any time.
      o	Press BACKSPACE to return to the previous step in the wizard.
    	
How to Remove a Directive:
  1.	Use the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to switch to “Remove Directive” mode.
  2.	The system directive hierarchy will be displayed. Expand the nodes using TAB until you find the specific rule you wish to delete.
  3.	Navigate to the rule using the UP/DOWN arrows and press the DELETE key.
  4.	A secure confirmation pop-up will appear. This is a critical safety measure to prevent accidental deletion.
  5.	To proceed, you must type the exact confirmation phrase found in the APOLLO Security Sequences.
  6.	Press ENTER. The component and all of its children will be permanently removed from config.json. If the code is incorrect, the action will be cancelled. Otherwise, press END to cancel operation.
  See Security Codes for sequences.
